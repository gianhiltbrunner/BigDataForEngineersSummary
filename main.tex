\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Are you capable of sketching the history of databases (ancient and modern) to a colleague in a few minutes?}

Early forms of databases include natural forms of information storage such as speaking, singing and writing. These forms became more complex in time when people performed simple accounting tasks using stone inscriptions and later on when books became widespread with the invention of the book press. The computer then finally enabled us to store and manage data on much larger scales.

In the 1960s file systems were introduced allowing simple forms of data managment, in the 1970s relational table databases such as SQL were introduced allowing systematic queries. In the 2000s other databases became more popular (NoSQL), these include key-value stores, triple stores, document stores and column stores.

\subsection{Do you know who Edgar Codd is?}

Edgar Codd was an English computer scientist who invented the relational model for database management, the theoretical basis for relational databases.

\subsection{Can you explain what Data Independence is, and why it is important?}

The actual data and application programs acting on the data remain unimpaired even if the storage representation or access methods are changed. This is important when we want to store small scale data on a single hard drive and store large scale data on cluster infrastructure but essentially want to access the data in the same manner.

\subsection{Do you know the rough conceptual difference between data, information, and knowledge?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Data is conceived of as symbols or signs, representing stimuli or signals lacing any interpretation.
    \item Information is inferred from data", in the process of answering interrogative questions (e.g., "who", "what", "where", "how many", "when"), thereby making the data useful for "decisions and/or action".
    \item Knowledge represents information combined with understanding, capability and experience.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Can you cite the five fundamental shapes of data, and how structured data can be characterized?}

Text, Tables, Trees, Graphs and Cubes

\begin{itemize}
    \item Data conforms to a data model and has easily identifiable structure
    \item Data is well organised so, Definition, Format and Meaning of data is explicitly known
    \item Data resides in fixed fields within a record or file
    \item Similar entities are grouped together to form relations or classes
    \item Entities in the same group have same attributes
    \item Easy to access and query, So data can be easily used by other programs
    \item Data elements are addressable, so efficient to analyse and process
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Can you briefly explain what a data model is?}

Underlying Questions

\begin{itemize}
    \item How does the data look like?
    \item What can be done with the data?
\end{itemize}

\noindent A data model is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities. For instance, a data model may specify that the data element representing a car be composed of a number of other elements which, in turn, represent the color and size of the car and define its owner.

\subsection{Do you know the 8 standard prefixes of the International System of Units (when the exponent in base 10 is a positive multiple of 3)?}

\begin{table}[H]

\end{table}

\subsection{Can you list the main four technologies commonly referred to as NoSQL?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Key-value stores
    \item Triple stores
    \item Column stores
    \item Document stores
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Do you know the three Vs?}


Big Data is defined by the three Vs.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Volume}: High amount of data.
    \item \textbf{Variety}: Different types and structures.
    \item \textbf{Velocity}: High rate of data throughput.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Can you briefly define capacity, throughput and latency? Do you know their typical units?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Capacity}: Volume of the stored data. (GB)
    \item \textbf{Throughput}: Speed of data transmission. (kbit/sec)
    \item \textbf{Latency}: Time until data is being received. (sec)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Can you explain why and how the evolution of capacity, throughput and latency over the last few decades has influenced the design of modern databases?}

While the capacity has increased 200,000,000,000 fold, the throughput has increased only 10,000 fold and the latency only 8 fold.

\subsection{Can you name a few big players in the industry that accumulate and analyze massive amounts of data?}

Google, AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure and many more

\subsection{Do you know the difference between bit and byte?}

One byte is a collection of 8 bits where a bit represents the most basic form of information storage: 1 or 0.

\subsection{Can you name a few concrete examples that illustrate the various orders of magnitude of amounts of data?}



\pagebreak

\section{Lessons learnt}
\subsection{Can you explain why it is important to take into consideration whether a use case is read-intensive, or write-intensive, or in-between?}


Write Intensive $\rightarrow$ \textbf{OLTP} (On-line Transaction Processing) is involved in the operation of a particular system. OLTP is characterized by a large number of short on-line transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). The main emphasis for OLTP systems is put on very fast query processing, maintaining data integrity in multi-access environments and an effectiveness measured by number of transactions per second. In OLTP database there is detailed and current data, and schema used to store transactional databases is the entity model (usually 3NF). It involves queries accessing individual record like updating an email record in a database.\\\\

\noindent Read Intensive $\rightarrow$ \textbf{OLAP} (On-line Analytical Processing) deals with historical data or archival data. OLAP is characterized by a relatively low volume of transactions. Queries are often very complex and involve aggregations. For OLAP systems a response time is an effectiveness measure. OLAP applications are widely used for data mining applications. In an OLAP database there is aggregated, historical data, stored in multi-dimensional schemas. Queries often access large amounts of data.

\subsection{Can you explain why normal forms are important?}

Normal forms are important to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. This is achieved by making sure that the data follows a set of rules corresponding to each of the normal forms.

\subsection{Can you describe the first normal form in simple terms?}

The first normal form expects the data to have a primary key ("id"), no repeating groups of entries (Not having columns such as "ChildName1" and "ChildName2") and atomicity of entries (No column such as "Children" with value e.g. "Max, Pia").

\subsection{Can you describe in simple terms (that is, without knowing the details of them) how higher normal forms (like Boyce-Codd) are related to joins?}

Higher order forms make sure that the data conforms to certain rules, thus when joining tables less conflicts occur.


\subsection{Can you explain why it is common, for large amounts of data, to drop several levels of normal form, and denormalize data instead?}

Denormalization is used to increase performance and scalability for large datasets. This leads to a increase in read performance while write performance suffers. This is due to the fact that relational databases need to perform many expensive JOIN operations when data is retrieved. These operations are prohibitively costly for very large datasets.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[+] Retrieving data is faster since we do fewer joins
    \item[+]Queries to retrieve can be simpler(and therefore less likely to have bugs), since we need to look at fewer tables.
    \item[-]Updates and inserts are more expensive.
    \item[-]Denormalization can make update and insert operations more complex.
    \item[-]Data may be inconsistent.
    \item[-]Data redundancy necessitates more storage.
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Can you give simple examples of denormalized data?}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{img/denormalization.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Can you explain what a declarative language is?}

Declarative languages such as SQL describe what needs to happen but do not care about how exactly something is happening. Thus we would tell the the interpreter to fetch an entry using SELECT but not really care about how this entry is selected. (e.g. looping over the entries, etc.)

\subsection{Can you explain what a functional language is?}

Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value.

\subsection{Can you explain why it matters to design query languages that are declarative and functional?}

Declarative languages make sure that the we don't "reinvent the wheel" every time we create a query. Functional languages basically have similar benefits. They use functions to perform many operations such as map instead of looping over an array manually, thereby hiding away complexity and making code more readable. 

\subsection{Can you describe the major relational algebra operators: select, project, group and aggregate, join, Cartesian product, union, intersection, etc?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SELECT}: Operation that subsets the data set given a condition. Such as SELECT all entries from the table Person whose age is larger than 34. ($\sigma_{\text{Age}\geq34}(\text{Person})$)
    \item \textbf{PROJECT}: Operation that picks a subset of all columns and drops duplicate entries. From table Person (Name, Age, Weight) project the columns Age and Weight to a new table while removing the Name column and excluding duplicate entries. ($	{\displaystyle \Pi _{\text{Age,Weight}}({\text{Person}})}$)
    \item \textbf{GROUP}: Operation that groups rows sharing the grouping property such that the groups can be aggregated in a subsequent operation. (e.g. SUM)
    \item \textbf{AGGREGATE}: Operation that summarizes multiple rows in a summarized form. Aggregate functions include: average, sum, median, standard deviation and many others. 
    \item \textbf{JOIN}: Operation that unites two tables by the set of tuples that match. (e.g. key) \item \textbf{CARTESIAN PRODUCT}: Operation that creates a new table based on all possible combinations.
    \item \textbf{UNION}: Operation that combines tables from two SELECT operations. 
    \item \textbf{INTERSECTION}: Operation that combines rows from tables that are present in both original data sets. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Do you know what each letter stands for in ACID and CAP?}

\textbf{ACID}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Atomicity: Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single "unit", which either succeeds completely, or fails completely.
    \item Consistency: Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.
    \item Isolation: Transactions are often executed concurrently (e.g., multiple transactions reading and writing to a table at the same time). Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially.
    \item Durability: Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash).
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{CAP}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Consistency: Every copy of a data set has to be modified upon completion of a transaction. Note that this is not the same as consistency in the ACID model. 
    \item Availability: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write
    \item Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Can you explain why, for large amounts of data, CAP becomes relevant over ACID?}

\noindent\textbf{ACID} addresses an individual node's data consistency\\
\textbf{CAP} addresses cluster-wide data consistency

\subsection{Do you know the names of the basic components of the tabular shape at an abstract level (table, row, column, primary key) as well as the names of the most common corresponding counterparts in the NoSQL world?}

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{SQL} & \textbf{NoSQL} \\ \hline
database     & database       \\ \hline
table        & collection     \\ \hline
row          & document       \\ \hline
column       & field          \\ \hline

\section{Object storage}
\subsection{Can you describe the limitations of traditional (local) file systems?}

Local file systems are limited in capacity by the hardware capacity, i.e. they cannot contain petabytes. Local filesystems can also have local hierarchical and does not allow flexible manipulation of it.

\subsection{Can you explain what object storage is?}

Object storage (also known as object-based storage) is a computer data storage architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures like file systems which manages data as a file hierarchy, and block storage which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks. (Wikipedia)

It uses a flat, simple and global key value model and flexible metadata to enable retention of a massive amount of unstructured data.

\subsection{Are you able to use further expressions (if-then-else, switch, ...)?}
\subsection{Do you understand how to dynamically build JSON content with object and arrayconstructors?}
\subsection{Do you understand that expressions can be combined at will, as any expression takesand returns sequences of items? Do you know how to use parentheses to make precedence clear, like you did in primary school with + and *?}
\subsection{Do you know the JSONiq type syntax (atomic types taken from XML Schema, syntaxfor object and array types, as well as cardinality symbols), and how to use typechecking (instance of, cast as, etc.)?}
\subsection{Given a collection of JSON objects (for example JSON Lines on HDFS), are you able touse Rumble to write JSONiq queries (FLWOR) that do projection? selection? (weleave grouping, join, ... aside in the context of this lecture, however you need to know that this can be done with JSONiq as well).}
