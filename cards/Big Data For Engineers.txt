What is tabular integrity	Som rows are missing, some columns undefined for certain rows.
What is atomic integrity?	It's the fact that a table does not contain other tables, each cell is an atomic type.
What is domain integrity	Not all rows have the same type for the same column, e.g. some booleans are 0 1 or true false

What is database normalization?	<b>Database normalization</b> is the process of structuring a relational database&nbsp;in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
What are the requirements for a 1NF?	4 rules:<div>1.&nbsp; Each column should contain atomic values.</div><div>2. A column should contain values that are of the same type.</div><div>3. Each column should have the same name</div><div>4. Order in which data is stored does not matter.</div>
What are the requirements for a table to be in second normal form?<div><br></div>	It should be in 1st normal form and it should not have any partial dependencies
What does dependency mean in the context of a table?	The value of a given row determines the value of the primary key
What is partial dependency?	It occurs when a primary key determines the outcome of another attribute or set of attributes. E.g. teacher id depends strictly on subject id.
What are the conditions for a table to be in 3rd normal form?	It should be in 2nd normal form and not have transitive dependency
What is transitive dependency?	The attribute depends on some other non primary attribute.

What is atomicity?	Either the entire transaction is applied or none of it. (rollback)
What defines the consistency of a transaction?&nbsp;	after a transaction, the database is in a consistent state again (i.e. any given database transaction must change affected data only in allowed ways)
What is isolation in the context of database transactions?	In database systems, <b>isolation</b> determines how transaction integrity is visible to other users and systems.
What is durability in the context of database transactions?	The updates may mot dissapear again
What are the new sets of criteria that databases should comply to?	The CAP theorem: consistency, availability and partition tolerance
What is atomic consistency according to this new paradigm?	All nodes see the same data.

What is the main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?	The first, second and third normal forms need not be respected. Heterogenous, nested and denormalized data are allowed.&nbsp;
What are the key differences in terms of the properties that need to be respected by transactions in SQL vs. NoSQL databases?	SQL: ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability).&nbsp;<div>NoSQL: CAP (atomic consistency, availability, partition tolerance and eventual consistency)</div>
What is eventual consistency?	<b>Eventual consistency</b> is a consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve high availability that informally guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value.

What does a datanode contain?	Data, in the form of blocks, on the disk
What does a datanode provide as an advantage?	Close to the hardware, which facilitates disk failure detection
What are the different communication protocols in a HDFS?	Client protocol between namenode and client. DataTransfer protocol between client and datanode and file writing pipeline and replication for communication between data nodes.
What are the elements of the client protocol?	Client sends to namenode metadata operations. Namenode sends back datanode location block IDs
Who initiates the connection between a namenode and a datanode?	The datanode, needs to send registration, heartbeat, blockreport and blockreceived every interval of time.
How does the data transfer protocol work?	Client connects directly to the datanodes and datablocks are send to a datanode which then replicates through pipelining to multiple other datanodes.
What are some examples of metadata functionalities?	Create directory, delete directory, write file, append to file, read file, delete file.
What happens if a client wants to read a file?	Client asks for the file to the namenode<div>The client gets block locations, multiple datanodes for each block sorted by distance.</div><div>The datanodes send their inputstream to the client</div>
What happens if a client wants to write a file?	Client sends create instruction.<div>Datanodes for the first block is received.</div><div>The writing pipeline is organized</div><div>Send the data over</div><div>Ack signal is sent once done (acknowledgment)</div><div>The namenode sends the datanodes for the second block</div><div>The writing pipeline is organized<br></div><div><div>Send the data over</div><div>Ack signal is sent once done (acknowledgment)</div></div><div><br></div>

If rep 1 and 2 were on same rack what would happen?	If failure, only one copy left.
Why 2 and 3 on same rack?	Better throughput
What is the problem with this slave master architecture?	Master represents a single point of failure
What do you want to have persist of the namenode?	The file namespace and the block id mapping, not the locations.
Why is the persistence of the block locations not required?	Can be provided via heartbeat protocol to master and data reconstituted this way.
What, in addition to the namespace file, do you also want to have persist while master is down?	The edit log to play through once restored.&nbsp;
How is the namenode restored?	After 30 minutes. Namespace file restored, then edit log is played through, then reconstitute locations for blocks.
How long does the restoring of a namenode require in naive conditions?	30 minutes
What are the tricks to reduce downtime after namenode knockout?	1. Make checkpoints to avoid having to play through the edit log unecessarily<div>2. Have standby namenodes</div><div>3. Have federated DFS to have multiple namenodes that have all the information necessary</div>

What changes when doing NoSQL?	The data is denormalized: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, B-C normal form etc is discarded
When is normalization useful and when is denormalization useful?	When data is write intensive, normalized data is useful to avoid update anomalies. When the data is read-intensive, the data needs to be highly denormalized because joins need to be avoided (intensive operation, requires a lot of processing and introduces latency).
What is data denormalized to first normal form?	A collection tuples.
What property do tuples have when nestedness is allowed?	Avoid repetition and data takes up less space.
What does a homogeneous collection of flat items in a relational database become in the NoSQL world?	They become a heterogeneous collection of arborescent items in a document store.
